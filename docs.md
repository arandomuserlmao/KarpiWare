## FAQ



### Q - Why is my preformance dropping upon script execution?

 #### A - Due to the nature of script obfuscation and how it runs, you will always recieve a slight or very noticable preformance decrease when using, for mor info, refer to our obfuscation service's documentation on script preformance - https://lura.ph/dashboard/documents/performance


  <br>


### Q - Why am I unable to execute the script?

 #### A - Make sure you are not using a VPN, using a supported executor, and have not been blacklisted, if you've tried all of this and still have not been able to use it, or have a question about this topic, ask support or an availible developer in the official Proton Utilites discord.
