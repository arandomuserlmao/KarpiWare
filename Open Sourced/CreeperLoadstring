    'RPG' - Uses RPG More effective and accurate due to it not being affected by networkownership, however it is more expensive
    
    'Grenade' - Grenade will sometimes stop locking onto your character if you are too close to a player for 
    too long due to networkownership, however this method is more cost effective (Also still locks on when you are 
    KO'd so maybe if someone tries to stomp you it will kill them)
